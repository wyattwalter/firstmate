Mode: Pi extension background wake.

When this session owns supervision and away mode is not active:
1. Drain first with `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh`.
2. Confirm the Pi primary auto-loaded both project extensions (plain `pi`, after approving project trust once per clone); if not, restart with `-e __FM_PI_TURNEND_EXT__ -e __FM_PI_EXT__` as a trust-free fallback.
3. Arm supervision by using the Pi command `/fm-watch-arm-pi` or the `fm_watch_arm_pi` tool.
4. The extension starts `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh --restart`, keeps the child attached to the live Pi process, and sends a follow-up user message when the child exits with an actionable watcher reason.
5. If the extension says the watcher is already healthy, do not start another cycle.
6. If the extension reports a watcher failure, drain queued wakes, inspect the failure text, and restart Pi with both extensions loaded if needed.
7. Never use shell `&` for watcher supervision.
   The arm mechanism above is extension-owned, not a model tool call, but a manual recovery probe that backgrounds, pipes, or bundles the arm is denied automatically by the PreToolUse seatbelt (`bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh`, wired into the turn-end guard extension at `__FM_PI_TURNEND_EXT__`).

The turn-end guard extension lives at `__FM_PI_TURNEND_EXT__`.
The watcher extension lives at `__FM_PI_EXT__`.
Both are tracked, project-local `.pi/extensions/*.ts` files that Pi auto-discovers once the project is trusted; `bin/fm-session-start.sh` reports when the running Pi session has not loaded both required extensions.
